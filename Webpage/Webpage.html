    <h2>Thank you for taking the time to find my page.</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Donald Thomas. I am making this page to start my coding
      journey. I am focusing on the path to improve everyday. I will be tracking
      my progress in hope of becoming a full time software developer. Today is
      June 18th 2025. Today marks the day that I begin on my self taught
      journey. The actual path to learning is by emersing myself into projects
      and finding out what I know and what I do not know. If I get stuck at a
      problem in my coding I will try to solve the issue on my own. If I am not
      able to solve the issue I will reach out for help. This is also where I
      will start joining coding communities to get insight to what companies are
      looking for and what other self taught developers are doing to land jobs.
      Thank you again for viewing my page and following along in my journey.
