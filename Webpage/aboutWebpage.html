    <h1>My thoughts</h1>
    <p>
      I pretty sure you are wondering who is this person and why are they taking
      up my time. Maybe you have seen me later on in my future. Maybe you just
      want to know. Where did it all begin? This is the first page that I am
      creating to show myself that I have what is takes to become a developer,
      designer, engineer, or what ever I decide to do. As of know I have learned
      the basic knowledge on CSS and HTML. I've been through countless videos to
      learn how to code. Every video has the same key principle. To get past the
      learning curve of coding you must have a number of projects under your
      belt. Coding isn't a skill that you can learn from following along. You
      will learn by making mistakes, and correcting those mistakes. And this
      will be the platform that I will be showcasing the mistakes that I have
      made along my path. This entire webpage will be filled with my
      accomplishments and misfortunes. Let's fail together.
